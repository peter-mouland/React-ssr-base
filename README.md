This repo was born from [React-Lego](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego) and uses all the learnings from that test to create a good place to start for SSR Single-page apps.

The main technologies are React, Koa v2, Babel and Webpack.

Authentication is handled locally with MongoDB as well as Passport integration.
